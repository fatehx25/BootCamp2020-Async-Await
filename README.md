This repository contains an introduction to Asynchronous Programming where promises, async and await are used.

Dive into index.js first to get a glance at asynchronous programming
Then surf into Callback_Hell.js to see how complex asynchronous programming can become
After that move into index_cp.js which uses promises to do the same task. 
After which async and await has been amalgamated with promises in index_cp_cp.js to do the same task.

In index.html, make sure to change the source of the script according to the js file you are in.
